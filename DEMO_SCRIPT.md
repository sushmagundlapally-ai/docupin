## Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:30)

**Talking Points:**
> "As knowledge workers, we bookmark dozens of documents every week—Google Docs, Quip pages, Confluence wikis, design specs. But finding them later? That's the real challenge."

> "Traditional bookmarks don't understand context. They can't search by meaning. They just pile up until you're drowning in links."

**Action:** Show trying to find a document in regular browser bookmarks (chaos)

**Visual:** Open DocuPin in browser (file:///Users/sushma.gundlapally/Documents/document-bookmarks/index.html)

**Talking Points:**
> "Meet DocuPin—an AI-powered bookmark manager that actually understands what you're looking for."

> "Built at the TPM Hackathon 2025, DocuPin uses Natural Language Processing to make your documents instantly searchable by meaning, not just keywords."

**Action:** Show the clean, modern interface with the gradient header and logo

## Scene 3: Adding Bookmarks (0:50 - 1:30)

2. Add custom title: "Q4 Product Roadmap"
3. Add tags: "roadmap, planning, Q4"

**Talking Points (continued):**
> "DocuPin automatically detects the platform and generates smart, contextual descriptions. You can add custom tags to organize by project, team, or theme."

## Scene 4: Smart Search in Action (1:30 - 2:30)
**Visual:** Search bar and results

**Talking Points:**
> "See those relevancy scores? That's our NLP algorithm calculating semantic similarity using techniques like Levenshtein distance and weighted scoring."

**Action 2 - Tag-based Search:**
1. Type: "roadmap"
2. Show how custom tags boost relevancy

**Talking Points:**
> "Custom tags get priority in search, so your organizational system actually makes search smarter."

## Scene 7: The "Why" - Value Proposition (3:40 - 4:00)

## Recording Tips

### Before Recording:
1. **Prepare sample bookmarks** - Add 10-15 realistic bookmarks across different platforms
2. **Clear browser clutter** - Close unnecessary tabs
3. **Test all features** - Make sure search, filters, and views work
4. **Prepare demo queries** - Have search terms ready that show good results

### During Recording:
1. **Screen resolution** - Use 1920x1080 for best quality
2. **Cursor highlight** - Use screen recording software that highlights clicks
3. **Smooth movements** - Move slowly and deliberately
4. **Pause briefly** - Give viewers time to read text on screen

### After Recording:
1. **Add captions** - Accessibility matters
2. **Background music** - Subtle, non-distracting
3. **Annotations** - Highlight key features with arrows/circles
4. **Transitions** - Use smooth transitions between scenes

## Alternative: Self-Running Demo

If you prefer not to do voiceover, create a silent demo with text overlays:

1. **Add text cards between scenes** - Explain what's happening
2. **Use annotations** - Circle/arrow to highlight features
3. **Overlay statistics** - Show "2x faster search" type metrics
4. **Background music only** - Upbeat, professional
5. **Captions for actions** - "Adding a bookmark..." "Searching by meaning..."

This works great for social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) where videos autoplay muted!
